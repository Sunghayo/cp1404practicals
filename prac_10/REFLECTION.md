# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was initially inconsistent. Some tasks took much longer than expected due to unforeseen complexity, while others were quicker than I anticipated.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I completed more practicals, my ability to estimate time improved significantly. I started breaking tasks into smaller parts and allocating time for each, which helped me predict better.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of analyzing the requirements thoroughly before starting and how to account for debugging and testing time in my estimates.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed helped me identify areas where my code could be more efficient, readable, or better structured. I also realized the importance of adhering to coding standards for consistency.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me recognize common mistakes and learn different approaches to problem-solving. It also improved my ability to evaluate and explain code clearly.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would integrate more detailed feedback opportunities for debugging skills.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled at breaking problems into smaller, manageable functions and writing reusable, modular code. I also consistently tested my code thoroughly and documented it well.
