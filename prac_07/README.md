## About Me and This Repository
Hi, I am Hwang Sungha. This repository contains my practical work for CP1404

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
- Magic numbers should always be stored as constants for better maintainability
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid code duplication by creating reusable functions and modules
- Meaningful Names: Choose descriptive variable and function names that clearly explain their purpose
